# Pac-Man - Rules of the Maze

## Introduction

Welcome to our Pac-Man game, a tribute to the real Pac-Man game! Navigate the maze, gobble up those pellets, and outsmart the ghosts to become the ultimate Pac-Master.

## Objective

Your mission, is to guide Pac-Man through the maze, eating all the pellets in sight while avoiding the relentless ghosts. Each pellet brings you closer to victory, but beware - the ghosts are hungry for a chase!

## Controls

- Use the arrow keys to navigate Pac-Man through the maze:
  - ↑ : move up
  - ↓ : move down
  - ← : move left
  - → : move right

## Gameplay

- **Pellets**: Consume all the pellets in the maze to advance to the next level.
- **Power Pellets**: Devour these special pellets to turn the tables on the ghosts. When Pac-Man eats a Power Pellet, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can gobble them up for extra points!
- **Ghosts**: Avoid the colorful ghosts - Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde. They're out to get you, but watch out! Each ghost has its own unique behavior.
- **Fruits**: Grab the occasional fruit that appears in the maze for bonus points. It's a risk worth taking!

## Points

Rack up points as you navigate the maze and outsmart the ghosts.

- **Pellet**: 10 points
- **Power Pellet**: 50 points
- **Eating Ghosts**: 200, 400, 800, 1600 points (Eat ghosts consecutively for increasing points)
- **Fruits**: Varying points - keep an eye out for these juicy bonuses!

## Lives

Pac-Man starts with 3 lives. Lose a life if caught by a ghost. If you're skilled enough, you might earn extra lives along the way. Use them wisely!

## Game Over

The game ends when Pac-Man runs out of lives. Can you achieve the high score and become the Pac-Master?

**Good luck, and may your Pac-Man skills shine in the maze!**
