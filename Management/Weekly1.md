## III. Issues and Challenges
<!--Highlight any significant issues or challenges that the team encountered during the week. Provide a brief description, the impact on the project or team, and proposed solutions or mitigation strategies.-->
The first challenge we faced was the project's delivery date, which was quite tight. By quite tight, I mean that we have 7 weeks to develop a Pac-Man game all in Assembly language, which represents hundreds or even thousands of code lines. Another actual challenge is to understand Assembly language, the dev team, helped by the QA is struggling a lot starting the project because of the difficulty of the language.

## IV. Recommendations
<!--Offer any recommendations or suggestions for improvement based on the week's experiences and outcomes.-->
- More Scrum method
- Better allocation of tasks for the dev team
- Be able to code in Assembly
- Write a document to use DosBox 

## V. Acknowledgements
<!--Acknowledge the contributions of team members, stakeholders, or external partners who played a significant role in the week's achievements.-->
- Functional progressed a lot (Lucas and Laura-Lee)
- Better understanding of DosBox
- Precise guideline
