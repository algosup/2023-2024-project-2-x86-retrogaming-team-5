## III. Issues and Challenges
<!--Highlight any significant issues or challenges that the team encountered during the week. Provide a brief description, the impact on the project or team, and proposed solutions or mitigation strategies.-->
We need to stay at less of 64Ko for the game folder, if we exceed 64Ko we will face more bugs than expected. As we are thursday, the eve of the final presentation, and a few minutes ago from merging our final working game, we still have this project of overflow with the game, so we deleted features from the game like the scoring system.

## IV. Recommendations
<!--Offer any recommendations or suggestions for improvement based on the week's experiences and outcomes.-->
No recommendations because we ended the project.

## V. Acknowledgements
<!--Acknowledge the contributions of team members, stakeholders, or external partners who played a significant role in the week's achievements.-->
We learned that sometimes it is more useful to use chatGPT to optimize our time and our efficiency working on a project. As we barely didn't used chatGPT for the code, we are now blocked with some issues that we didn't manage to troubleshoot.
