## Project overview

We were asked to recreate the classic Pac-Man in assembly x86 on DOSBox emulator as simple as posssible while
upgrade the basic gameplay, better randomness, score management, high scores, sounds and musics.

As a reminder Pac-man is a video game made by Toru Iwatani for the enterprise Namco. It was released on May 22, 1980. The game consist to eat all the dots with Pac-man while avoiding four colored ghosts.

## project goal

- Project duration: 7 weeks
- Technology: assembly
- Platform: DOSBox emulator, which is playable on computers

## Game's rules

### Win condition

The player win a level when he eats all dots in the map without losing all is lives.

### Loose condition

When the player lost all of is lives, he lose.
to loose a life the player needs to be touch by a ghosts.

### Game board

The game board is a square with maze. the walls are'nt traversable. We add pipes and each side of the map.
There pipes can teleport the player at the inverse side.

We use the same graphical charter of the original Board game of Pac-Man but we modify the map like google create a different map of the traditional game.

### Character

#### Player

The player control Pac-Man and these objectives are have the maximum score value and rest in life. He cans take power-up and fruit to have more points and bonus to kill the enemies.
The player can eat fruits and there give more score value, and when he eats a power up he can eat the ghosts and he's more speed.

#### Ghosts

Ghosts are the enemies of the player and this objectives it's kill the player. they have a random pattern to search and kill the player. Some are more passive and others more aggressive.
When the player eat a power-up the ghosts are scared and flees Pac-Man.

### Item

#### Fruits

We have differents fruits which gives differents points depending of the level.

The first fruits is a cherry and he cans give 100 points. The second is a strawberry and he gives 300 points. after we have the orange with 500 points, the apple with 700 points, the melon with 1000 points, the Galaxian with 2000 points, the bell with 3000 points and for fini we have the key he can gives 5000 points.

#### Power-up

When the player eats a power-up the ghosts are scared and flees the player. The player has extra speed and can eat ghosts. When he eats a ghost ha has bonus scored.
We have only 4 power-up per level split in the board.

## Out of scope

The first idea was to create a new design for Pac-Man inspired by Japanese culture, but after brainstorming, we decided to reject this idea, because it was out of reach to code it in Assembly.

For the second idea we wanted to play Pac-Man in first-person, but we thought it was irrelevant and out of reach to code it in Assembly.
