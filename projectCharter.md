**Project Manager:** Guillaume Deramchi
**Date:** 11/17/2023

## Project Purpose

The purpose of the Pac-Man Revival project is to recreate the classic Pac-Man game using assembly language. This project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience for team members, allowing them to enhance their programming skills and gain practical knowledge in game development.

## Project Objectives

1. **Recreate Classic Pac-Man Gameplay:**
   - Develop a simple Pac-Man game with gameplay faithful to the classic version.

2. **Assembly Language Proficiency:**
   - Enhance team members' proficiency in assembly language programming through practical application.

3. **Hands-On Game Development Experience:**
   - Provide team members with hands-on experience in various aspects of game development, including rendering, user input and collision detection.

4. **Collaborative Teamwork:**
   - Foster teamwork and collaboration among team members by working on a shared project with distinct roles and responsibilities.

5. **Project Presentation:**
   - Prepare a final project presentation or demo to showcase the completed Pac-Man game to stakeholders and the wider community.

## Project Scope

**Inclusions:**
- Rendering of game grid, Pac-Man, and ghosts.
- User input for Pac-Man movement.
- Ghost behaviors, including chasing and random movements.
- Collision detection between game elements.
- Scoring system and UI elements (score, lives, level indicator).
- [OPTIONAL] Sound effects and optional background music.

**Exclusions:**
